# SauceDemo E2E Automation Framework

This project implements an end-to-end automation framework for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) web application. It covers login, cart, and checkout functionalities using Selenium WebDriver with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

## üéØ Project Objective

Automate core user workflows on SauceDemo with robust test scenarios, parallel execution.

## üöÄ Scope of Automation

1. **Login Functionality**  
   - Automate all authentication scenarios for multiple user roles.

2. **Add Items to Cart**  
   - Validate cart behavior across different users.

3. **Complete Purchase**  
   - Verify successful checkout process for valid users.

4. **Error Handling with Problem User**  
   - Detect and document UI and functional issues for problematic user roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Framework:** Selenium WebDriver with Java  
- **Design Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM)  
- **Parallel Execution:** Implemented using TestNG with ThreadLocal for thread safety  
- **Test Scenarios:** Separate test classes for each page/functionality


## üéØ Key Features

- Modular and maintainable automation with POM  
- Parallel test execution to reduce overall runtime  
- ThreadLocal usage to ensure safe parallel runs  
- Comprehensive test coverage for core SauceDemo functionalities  
- Robust error detection for different user roles, including the "problem user"
